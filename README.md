### Technical Slack
**TODO**: Describe the languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools that went into your project. Make sure to add a brief description of its utility, unlike the list below.

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

In this project I will be utilizing libraries from bootstrap for possible schematics for my website.

### Implementation
**TODO**: Complete this while you're working on your project. Preferably, you're describing what steps you took for different parts of the project.

Utilize personal resources. By this I mean just contact people who have created websites already and who have experience in web development to help start the process in creating a webstie

Watch online tutorials for how to make the navigation bar as well as how to just work with HTML in order to create a good looking website that has functionality as well.

Look into link implementation for when the user clicks on links for the website, they get redirected some place else (such as a resume/linkedin/github)

### Supplementary Material
**TODO**: Include any links to materials that might help people learn more about your project.
